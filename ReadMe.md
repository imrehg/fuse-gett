FUSE-Ge.tt
==========

FUSE [File System in Userspace][1] access to your [Ge.tt][2] shares. Eventually it will support adding and deleting shares and files, reliable upload, sharing and so on.

I'm not affiliated with Ge.tt in any ways, just making this to enhance their functionality for my requirements, and to play around with Python, fuse and [their API][5].

Requirements
============

[Python][3] and [fusepy][4].

Usage
=====

When it will work, I'll update it here.

Contribution
============

Happy to receive any contribution, send me a message, or even better, a pull request that can be checked, discussed, and if it works, merged.
